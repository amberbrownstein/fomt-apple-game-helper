An easy way to keep track of the apple positions in Huang's apple game from Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town. This hasn't been tested for the original Harvest Moon version of the game, but it should work for both.


How to use this app:

There are 6 possible move sequences for Huang's apple game, corresponding to the different rearrangement possibilities of the apples. In order to identify which sequence is being used, you can focus solely on where the left apple is moving each time it moves.


The 3 different apples are the following: Hyper Miracle Sweet Gorgeous Beautiful (HMSGB or H for short), Super Ultra Great Delicious Wonderful (SUGDW or S for short), and Angel Eternal Pure Fresh Elegant (AEPFE or A for short). The initial arrangement will always be SHA at the start of the game.


This app will keep track of the apple arrangement and update it after each sequence so that you can win the game with minimal manual effort. All you need to do is indicate which sequence occurred after each round.

The following sequence keys incorporate both the legacy strategy and early exit strategies. If using the <a href="https://fogu.com/hmforum/viewtopic.php?t=37256">original guide</a>, you generally only need to take note of the left apple's position after its first 2 movements; however, if its first 2 movements land it in the center position and then the right position, you must follow it to the end and take note of its final position. For your convenience, I have also denoted early exit conditions for each sequence so that players can choose either strategy while using this app.

C--L - left apple moves to center, stays still next 2 steps, then moves to left

Legacy: CL

Early Exit: C-

Result: Apple 3 moves to first position (SHA -> ASH)

R--C - left apple moves to right, stays still next 2 steps, then moves to center

Legacy: RC

Early Exit: R-

Result: Apples 1 and 3 switch places (SHA -> AHS)

RL - left apple moves to right, then to left

Legacy: RL

Early Exit: RL

Result: No change (SHA -> SHA)

CRL(C) - left apple moves to center, then to right, then to left, eventually lands at center

Legacy: CR(C)

Early Exit: CRL

Result: Apples 1 and 2 switch places (SHA -> HSA)

CRC-(L) - left apple moves to center, then to right, then to center, then stays still, eventually lands at left

Legacy: CR(L)

Early Exit: CRC-

Result: Apples 2 and 3 switch places (SHA -> SAH)

CRCL(R) - left apple moves to center, then to right, then to center, then to left, eventually lands at right

Legacy: CR(R)

Early Exit: CRCL

Result: Apple 1 moves to last position (SHA -> HAS)
